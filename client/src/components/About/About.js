                    The Alumni Cell is the Institute’s student-run cell to
                    connect and broaden the alum network. It started as a group
                    of 4 individuals but now encompasses 5 teams working to
                    improve Alum-Institute-Student Relations. The Yearbook was
                    one such initiative undertaken by the Cell. Starting with
                    the Class of 2022, the Yearbook’s First Edition was a
                    smashing success and helped the alums and the students
                    connect more. Following the same, the Yearbook Portal is
                    another initiative headed by the Web Development Division of
                    the Alumni Cell.<br></br> A one-stop hub to curate your
                    Yearbook profile and help others do the same. This is the
                    very first edition of the Yearbook Portal, and we would love
                    to hear your comments and suggestions so we can improve in
                    the coming years.{' '}

                  Dear Class of 2023,<br/><br/>
                  I extend a sincere congratulations and best of luck to the Class of 2023. While
                  your days as a student have come to an end, your connection to IIT Indore lasts
                  for a lifetime. Take advantage of the opportunities provided by our global alumni
                  network – leverage it and contribute to it.<br/>
                  In the coming years, I urge that you not forget your alma mater, professors, and
                  fellows. I encourage you to not only give back to the institute, but also keep us
                  updated on the many achievements you will experience in your careers and
                  personal lives. We will always take great pride in your achievements.<br/><br/>
                  Take care and keep in touch,<br/>
                  Congratulations once again!

                        Just click on the ‘Profile’ button, and you’re good to go.

                        However, after a particular date - of which you’ll be informed well in advance - your profile will be locked, and the same details would be used for printing.
